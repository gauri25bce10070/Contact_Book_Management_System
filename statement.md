In daily life, managing contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email IDs can become difficult if stored randomly or on paper.
There is a need for a simple tool that allows users to store and manage contact information quickly without using complicated applications or databases.

# 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to build a "Contact Book Management System using Python" that can:

- Display all saved contacts
- Search specific contacts
- Delete unwanted contacts

This system will help users maintain and access contacts in an organized way through a simple menu-driven interface.

# 3. Target Users
The system is suitable for:
- Students learning programming and data management
- Individuals who want a small tool for storing limited contacts
- Beginners who want to understand Python list and function-based applications

# 4. Scope of the Project
This project covers:
- Adding, viewing, searching and deleting contacts
- Storing name, phone number, and email
- Works on any system with Python installed
- No external modules required

# 5. Features Overview
- Add Contact: Stores name, phone, and email 
- View Contacts: Displays all saved contacts 
- Search Contact: Searches by name
